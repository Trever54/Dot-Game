# Dot-Game
Spring 2015 - This program was created for my Rigid Game Body Simulation course at MSU Denver in an effort to better understand the LWJGL3 libraries. It's quite simple and wasn't intended to be expanded upon. Due to learning purposes there are also some unnecessary comments scattered throughout the program. I decided to put this here because I think the game itself has some uniqueness. It was designed and implemented by myself.
